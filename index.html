    // ======= FLASHCARDS DATA =======
    const flashcards = [
      // TCP
      {question: "What type of protocol is TCP?", answer: "TCP is a connection-based protocol, meaning a connection must be established before data transfer."},
      {question: "Is TCP reliable or unreliable?", answer: "TCP is reliable; it uses acknowledgements, sequence numbers, and retransmissions."},
      {question: "How does TCP ensure error checking?", answer: "TCP ensures data integrity and correct order delivery."},
      {question: "What control mechanisms does TCP use?", answer: "TCP uses flow and congestion control to manage data efficiently."},
      {question: "What type of communication does TCP support?", answer: "TCP supports unicast (one-to-one) communication."},
      {question: "Is TCP fast or slow compared to UDP?", answer: "TCP is slower due to connection management and reliability features."},
      {question: "Which protocols use TCP?", answer: "HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP use TCP."},

      // UDP
      {question: "What type of protocol is UDP?", answer: "UDP is connectionless; data is sent directly without establishing a connection."},
      {question: "Is UDP reliable or unreliable?", answer: "UDP is unreliable; packets may be lost or arrive out of order."},
      {question: "How does UDP handle error checking?", answer: "UDP uses basic checksum for minimal error checking."},
      {question: "Does UDP use flow or congestion control?", answer: "UDP has no flow or congestion control."},
      {question: "What communication types does UDP support?", answer: "UDP supports unicast, broadcast, and multicast."},
      {question: "Is UDP faster or slower than TCP?", answer: "UDP is faster and has lower latency."},
      {question: "Which services commonly use UDP?", answer: "DNS, VoIP, video/voice streaming, and online gaming use UDP."},

      // Transport Layer
      {question: "What is tracking individual conversations in the transport layer?", answer: "The transport layer keeps track of multiple communication sessions to prevent data mixing."},
      {question: "What does segmenting data and reassembling segments mean?", answer: "Large data streams are broken into smaller segments and reassembled correctly."},
      {question: "What is adding header information?", answer: "Each segment gets a header including source/destination ports, sequence numbers, and error-checking info."},
      {question: "How does the transport layer identify applications?", answer: "It uses port numbers to identify which application or service the data belongs to."},
      {question: "What is conversation multiplexing?", answer: "It allows multiple applications to send and receive data simultaneously using unique ports."},

      // LAN addresses
      {question: "What are the two primary addresses on a LAN device?", answer: "MAC address (physical) and IP address (local)."},
      {question: "What is the purpose of the MAC address?", answer: "Used for NIC-to-NIC communication on the same network."},
      {question: "What layer does the MAC address operate on?", answer: "Layer 2 – Data Link Layer."},
      {question: "What is the purpose of the IP address?", answer: "Identifies devices logically and is used to send packets to destinations."},
      {question: "What layer does the IP address operate on?", answer: "Layer 3 – Network Layer."},
      {question: "Which address delivers the data link frame?", answer: "The Layer 2 physical (MAC) address."},

      // Switching
      {question: "What is Cut-Through Switching?", answer: "Forwards frame immediately after reading destination MAC."},
      {question: "What is Store-and-Forward Switching?", answer: "Receives entire frame, checks for errors, then forwards it."},
      {question: "What is Fast-Forward Switching?", answer: "Forwards frame immediately after reading destination MAC; very low latency."},
      {question: "What is Fragment-Free Switching?", answer: "Waits for first 64 bytes before forwarding to avoid collision fragments."},

      // DHCP
      {question: "What does DHCP stand for?", answer: "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol."},
      {question: "What is DHCP?", answer: "Automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration to devices."},
      {question: "Why is DHCP useful?", answer: "Prevents IP conflicts and reduces manual network setup."},

      // Email, ICMP, ARP
      {question: "Primary purpose of SMTP?", answer: "Send emails from client to mail server or between servers."},
      {question: "What does POP usually do after downloading emails?", answer: "Typically deletes emails from the server."},
      {question: "Purpose of ICMP?", answer: "Used for error reporting, diagnostics, and network management."},
      {question: "ICMP message to test host reachability?", answer: "ICMP Echo Request; replies with Echo Reply."},
      {question: "After sending ARP request, which device replies?", answer: "The device with the matching IP address replies with its MAC address."},

      // Port Numbers
      {question: "Port 20 is commonly used for which protocol?", answer: "FTP (File Transfer Protocol)"},
      {question: "Port 22 is commonly used for which protocol?", answer: "SSH (Secure Shell)"},
      {question: "Port 25 is commonly used for which protocol?", answer: "SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)"},
      {question: "Port 67 is commonly used for which protocol?", answer: "DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)"},
      {question: "Port 80 is commonly used for which protocol?", answer: "HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)"},
      {question: "Port 110 is commonly used for which protocol?", answer: "POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3)"},
      {question: "Port 143 is commonly used for which protocol?", answer: "IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)"},
      {question: "Port 161 is commonly used for which protocol?", answer: "SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)"}
